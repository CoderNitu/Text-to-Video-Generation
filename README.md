# Text-to-Video-Generation
Generative AI is a rapidly growing field that focuses on developing algorithms that can create content independently, without being explicitly programmed. Text-to-video synthesis is one of the most fascinating applications of this technology, as it allows us to generate videos from simple text prompts. Here I learn how to input a simple text prompt, configure the pre-trained diffusion model, and generate a video. 

## Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, music, and videos. GAI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data with similar characteristics. GAI can learn from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts that reflect the characteristics of the training data but don't repeat it. Inputs and outputs to GAI models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data.
